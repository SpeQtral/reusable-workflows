This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows for common maintenance tasks and upkeep of repositories. The reusable workflows themselves are located in the `/workflows` folder. The `/templates` folder contains `.yml` files which call these workflows. These can be dropped in directly into the `/.github/workflows` directories of repositories in which you wish to use these workflows. The benefit of using these templates instead of adding in the reusable workflow directly is that the target repository will automatically benefit from improvements to these reusable workflows as they are pushed.

At the moment, there is only 1 reusable workflow (`artifact-cleanup.yml`) and 1 corresponding template (`scheduled-workflow-cleanup.yml`). This automatically deletes GitHub Actions artifacts that are older than 3 days, every night. It can also be manually triggered with a user-specified age cutoff.
